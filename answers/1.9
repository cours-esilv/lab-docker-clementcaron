I used 'docker ps' to visualize the running containers. I see my running container.
Then I wanted to rename it so I stopped it using 'docker stop heuristic_galois' and I delete it.
Then I run: docker run --name back_app -d -e CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT=development -p 5000:5000 clementcarton/my-flask-app:latest
