I created a Dockerfile with the command 'nano Dockerfile'. In this Dockerfile I used:

'FROM python:3.9' To specify the base image, here we will use a Python Image.

'WORKDIR /app' To  specify the working directory in the 'app' folder. It's in this dir where we are going to run the next instructions.

'COPY . /app' to copy the app

'RUN pip install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies defined in the requirements.txt file

'CMD ["python3", "-m", "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]' to specify the command to run the app.
