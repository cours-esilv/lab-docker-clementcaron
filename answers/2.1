Here's my docker-compose.yml:

version: '3'
services:
  back-end:
    image: clementcarton/my-flask-app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT=development
  front-end:
    image: clementcarton/my-nginx-app 
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - WS_BACK_URL=http://5000-coursesilv-labdockercle-apw8j4hzd8p.ws-eu108.gitpod.io/

And here's what I used to run it:

docker-compose up -d

Then I see it created with docker-compose ps.
I also used docker-compose down to shutdown the container.
